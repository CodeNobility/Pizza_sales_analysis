# Pizza Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a pizza sales dataset using SQL, focusing on deriving business insights through queries ranging from beginner to advanced levels. The dataset includes four CSV files: `order_details`, `orders`, `pizzas`, and `pizza_types`. By integrating these tables, the project answers complex questions related to pizza sales, popular items, and customer behavior.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following files:
1. **order_details.csv** – Details of each pizza order.
2. **orders.csv** – General information about the orders placed.
3. **pizzas.csv** – Information about the pizzas available, such as size and price.
4. **pizza_types.csv** – A list of pizza types with descriptions and category data.

## Key Features
- **SQL Queries**: Queries to answer various business questions such as popular pizza types, sales trends, and customer order behavior.
- **Data Aggregation**: Uses SQL functions to aggregate data and provide insights on sales performance.
- **Table Joins**: Combines data from multiple tables to enrich analysis.
  
## How to Use
1. **SQL Scripts**: The SQL queries are saved in individual `.sql` files and should be run in order on a relational database environment that supports SQL (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite).
2. **Database Setup**: Import the CSV files into a SQL database and ensure that the table structure aligns with the dataset schema.

## Instructions
1. Clone or download the project folder.
2. Import the CSV files into your database.
3. Run the provided SQL files in sequence to execute queries and analyze the data.
